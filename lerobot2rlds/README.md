# LeRobot to RLDS

RLDS stands for Reinforcement Learning Datasets and it is an ecosystem of tools to store, retrieve and manipulate episodic data in the context of Sequential Decision Making including Reinforcement Learning (RL), Learning for Demonstrations, Offline RL or Imitation Learning.

For more details, please check [official repo](https://github.com/google-research/rlds).

## âœ¨ Motivation

Some classic works like [OpenVLA](https://github.com/openvla/openvla), [Octo](https://github.com/octo-models/octo), etc. currently only support reading the RLDS format. To meet the communityâ€™s needs, we provide a script that converts the popular LERobot format into the RLDS format.
